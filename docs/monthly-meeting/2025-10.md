## Reports and celebrations

- [Stan] With the [release of Python 3.14](https://discuss.python.org/t/104210/>),
  [docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/) now points to it! ü•ß

  **Action: Hugo deserves a good break after all that work;-)**

- [Stan] The [Romanian translation](https://docs.python.org/ro/3.14/) has been
  added to the language switcher!


## Discussion

- [Stan] Reminder for translations that have not yet started translating
  Python 3.14, it has been [released today](https://discuss.python.org/t/104210/).
  - [Adam] We do use translations from the closest available version if they're
    not available for the current version.

- [Adam] Someone complained in [an issue](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/139707)
  that we don't document `compression.zstd` as only available if you have the
  zstd library installed. Should we close this?
  - [Joe] There is a note in the [sqlite3 module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
    that notes the SQLite 3 requirement.
  - **Summary:** This is a widespread issue with many similar modules, the topic
    also came up during the [PEP 775](https://peps.python.org/pep-0775/) discussion.
    Suggestions included revising the [Build Requirements](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#build-requirements)
    page in the documentation and improving its visibility, or including notes on
    each page.
    [PEP 534](https://peps.python.org/pep-0534/) wanted to make error
    messages for missing modules more friendly,
    but has been deferred, contact Petr if you would like to pick it up.

  **Action: Petr to investigate the issue**

- [Hugo] Tutorial about concurrency
  - **Summary:** There is an open [Pull Request](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/123163)
    by Eric Snow that requires some work.

- [Adam] Should we rename the ‚Äútutorial‚Äù to ‚Äútour‚Äù?
  - **Summary:** There was consensus that the term would be more representative
  of what the documents really are.

- [Maciek] [Interactive docs](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-console-embedded-in-docs/38477/12)
  -- very early attempt with PyScript, with some issues, planning to share it soon.

- [Trey] Naming of argument syntax in signatures
