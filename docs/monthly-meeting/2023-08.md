## Discussion

- Should we set up [Trusted Publishers](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/using-a-publisher/) on python-docs-theme?
  - Pradyun will file an issue

- [Hugo] Plausible trial update
  - Public Dashboard [link expired]
  - Would be too expensive to pay for hosted version
  - Should be easy to host it ourselves on PSF infra
  - Next step:
    - Ask PSF/Ee if we want to self-host, or pay for the service (or get sponsored)
    - Let the SC look at the dashboard

- [Hugo] Dark theme deploy: 3.11 RM Pablo said fine to deploy. To deploy, need to merge [python/docsbuild-scripts#161](https://github.com/python/docsbuild-scripts/pull/161) and/or pin in `requirements.txt`

- [CAM] Update on structured deprecation work
    - Originally prompted by [a recent Discourse thread on soft deprecations](https://discuss.python.org/t/formalize-the-concept-of-soft-deprecation-dont-schedule-removal-in-pep-387-backwards-compatibility-policy/27957/73)
    - Went through many iterations of design and testing on examples
    - Wrote up a [detailed design doc](https://hackmd.io/@CAM-Gerlach/BJuLFRLj2) with:
        - Rationale and benefits
        - Phased implementation plan
        - Directive input schema
        - JSON, etc. output schema
        - Worked through examples
        - Open questions and additional notes
    - Initial implementation currently in progress; should have a final

- [Daniele] On-going documentation commit approaches
    - suggest changing approach to docs PRs
      - Often a PR will make docs look *worse* -- highlight what needs to be changed
      - docs no longer need to target only "graybeards", but also many new "non-programmers"
    - [CAM] Maybe also discussion of the [Porting Guide PR](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/107434) as an application of this?
    - Maybe mark documents as historical?
    - Forward plan: Merge Daniele's PR and open an issue for a followup to remove/update more outdated content


## Next meeting

The docs team generally meets on the first Tuesday of every month.
