## Discussion

- [Adam] Frequency of rebuilds of [`docs.python.org/3/`](https://docs.python.org/3/): [python/docsbuild-scripts#163](https://github.com/python/docsbuild-scripts/issues/163)
  - Is it OK for the PDFs to lag behind the HTML pages?
  - We could build English HTML every 4-6 hours but translations & PDFs only daily.
  - We don't know how long the build takes.
  - Could we move to Read the Docs?
  - Perhaps redirect 404s for archives that aren't build yet to earlier versions: could `https://docs.python.org/3.11/archives/python-3.11.999-docs-pdf-letter.zip` serve HTML that explains things and links to `https://docs.python.org/3.11/archives/` ?
  - Action: Adam to write up something & ask Julien.
- [Hugo] Adopting opengraph preview images for d.p.o: [python/docsbuild-scripts#147](https://github.com/python/docsbuild-scripts/issues/147)
- [Adam] Shutting down [`docs@python.org`](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/docs@python.org/latest)
  - Action: Petr to think about / redirect posts to GH Issues.
- [Mariatta/Joanna/Ned] [PEP for Python Editorial Board](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDaf87xtuKQ9txA6XUS-kQbgmLseUrOD1EBwl5PheSw/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Ege] What is the status of "[analysing docs.python.org using Google Search Console](https://github.com/python/docs-community/issues/64)"?
  - Would have been nice to have, but doesn't look feasible for now. Hopefully, it will be discussed along with *Plausible hosting*.
  - We can look into alternatives, such as [Google LightHouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/).
- [Ege/Hugo/Maciej/CAM] Plausible & Weblate hosting updates (response from the PSF?)
  - [CAM] Emailed Deb a couple weeks ago with the summary of our consensus on the last meeting, but still waiting (again :( ) on a reply.
