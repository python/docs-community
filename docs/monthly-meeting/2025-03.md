## Discussion

- [Hugo] wiki.python.org

  - Elena from Australia has been finding important info in the wiki, focused on
    communities. Keith is interested in education & outreach.
  - [Keith] There are multiple groups who decided recently that something should happen
    to the wiki. It would be nice to organize that, and part of that is understanding
    the scope.
  - What is the relationship between the docs & the wiki?
  - [Hugo] The old info is not useful, but people are still updating the wiki and adding
    useful info.
  - Info in the docs should not be duplicated in the wiki. We should avoid linking to
    the wiki; if we do link we should be explicit that this is a community-maintained
    wiki.
  - [Carol] I know that some people like the wiki, but it's not a good place for project
    documentation.
  - [Keith] From the education & outreach perspective & former Python subredditor &
    Python Discord mod: people who find the wiki very quickly get to outdated
    information. We want to change that.
  - Moving wiki to Git is an interesting idea, but takes a lot of work. If we start
    updating, people will start saying “my resource should be here too”
  - [Carol] audited the python.org & links two levels from Documentation, made sure
    links to official docs are first, then educational resources, then the wiki. It
    shouldn't be the first place people go to for information.
  - [Keith] Is the audit publicly available? What is a good format to make an audit, so
    we can share actionable information?
  - [Carol] can share that with Keith & Elena
  - [Keith] What's a good format? How do we avoid duplicating work and move to some
    version of “better”?
  - [Carol] Start at the homepage, see where the links lead
  - From the history, it's best to approach it as an external resource. That is in some
    ways how it's been managed. From an education point of view, it would be good to get
    the homepage to the point where it would be good for new contributors.
  - [Maciek] On Wikipedia, they use bots to add “this is outdated” banners. Should we
    try to do that? Add banners for up-to-date content, redirects to newer resources for
    outdated info?
  - [Hugo] The wiki will be updated to new MoinMoin soon, let's not do automation now.
  - Some news sites have also been adding banners for older articles.
  - [Keith] How would you define wiki content that should be moved to docs.python.org?
  - [Hugo] d.p.o is mainly focused on the tutorial and reference guide; it should fit
    there.
  - [Carol] Historical information -- something Guido or Barry wrote early on to give
    context -- we should move that as well. Perhaps not to docs.python.org, but
    somewhere else under python.org.
  - [Ryan] Diátaxis says what should go in docs; if it's not in one of the categories it
    should not go in docs.
  - [Keith] Lots of good things to talk about; I don't know what my conclusion will be
  - [Carol] It would be great if the Education & Outreach Workgroup makes a landing
    page, perhaps with content from the wiki.
  - [Keith] That's the end goal

- [Hugo] Any news from the EB?

  - [Carol] They have met, I've missed a few meetings. Will meet next week, maybe we can
    put something public up. There are plans to audit of some of the docs.

- [Hugo] We're using the latest version of Sphinx for latest version of the docs and the
  bugfix versions. Previously we limited this to what various distributors use. That
  also means that if we need something new in the docs, we can add it to Sphinx
  relatively quickly.

- [Maciek] Translation dashboard: we started to track the change in last 30 days; it's
  shown with a different colour.

  - Sphinx build warnings and lint errors are in progress.

- [Hugo] Ryan, you made some PRs, are they getting reviews?
  - [Ryan] Going great!
