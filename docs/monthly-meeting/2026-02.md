## Discussion

* Why don't we just add a manual?
  https://discuss.python.org/t/are-new-python-devs-forgetting-the-zen-of-python-there-should-be-one-and-preferably-only-one-obvious-way-to-do-it/105130/51
* [Hugo] Savannah coded a demo to embed a REPL in the browser; Hugo integrated
  it with the docs: https://hugovk-cpython.readthedocs.io/en/pyrepl/tutorial/introduction.html
  * The required changes: https://github.com/python/cpython/compare/main...hugovk:cpython:pyrepl
  * Would this be safe to deploy? It can probably get to the user's cookies, etc.
* [Ryan] I recently found [A Conceptual Overview of asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/a-conceptual-overview-of-asyncio.html#a-conceptual-overview-of-asyncio)
  and found it very useful.  Does the docs community want more articles like this?
* [Stan] An Editorial Board issue
  ([python/editorial-board#37](https://github.com/python/editorial-board/issues/37))
  open for a while.
  * It also has a CPython issue, [python/cpython#141811](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/141811).
  * A page pointing to the new locations should be left,
    like [this one](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/domains.html)
    in the Sphinx doc.
  * We use [sphinxext-rediraffe](https://sphinxext-rediraffe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    in the devguide (https://github.com/python/devguide/blob/d5ca1b4aea6281aa66ce4b25b9889e6f89c0d2fe/conf.py#L108)
    for redirects.
  * Doc redirects are currently managed by nginx:
    https://github.com/python/psf-salt/blob/main/salt/docs/config/nginx.docs-redirects.conf
  * [sphinx-reredirects](https://documatt.com/sphinx-reredirects) could be used?
* [Ned] The Editorial Board is inactive lately. If people have ideas about how
  to evolve it, let them know.
* [Stan] If anyone has time, if they could please review this little guide
  I wrote for merging back in translations after docs move in the devguide:
  [python/devguide#1700](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1700).
