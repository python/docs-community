      Phebe Polk is starting an initiative to promote Code Reading in the Python
      community. Blaise also recorded a [Code Reading testimonial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hkwYIk9EB0).
- [@blaisep] Reminder that next Monday is the Monthly Free Threading docs meeting (thanks @hugovk).


## Discussion

- [@blaisep] The Calendar event showed up for 15:00 ET, perhaps that accounted
  for the low attendance (group consensus: it was the post holiday lag).
