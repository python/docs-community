## Discussion

* (CAM) Should we enable Intersphinx support on the CPython 3.12 docs? It would primarily benefit porting/syncing docs from other places, like PEPs, importlib metadata/resources, and packaging, but could cause problems for downstreams (e.g. Linux distros) building the docs from source without network access. See [python/cpython#97785](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/97785/).

   * Allows single source of truth for definitions, etc.
   * Not offline buildable
   * Petr: would like Sphinx to provide a directory to reference local inv files to do offline builds
   * next steps: Cam to open a PR in 3.12, also a Discuss thread. Petr to open an issue in Sphinx.

* Docs to support Sphinx 5.x. @CAM-Gerlach wants to add a CI workflow during the sprint week for the oldest-supported version of Sphinx.
    * Adam will work on sphinx support on python-docs-theme

* (Ezio) Should we enable the default role and alias it to `:literal:` (`` `...` ``) for docs.python.org?
  * Less typing required, and [no more errors caused by MarkDown-like `` `...` `` in rst documents](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/97998)
  * It's not used for anything, so we could use it instead of (or as an alias to) ` ``...`` `
  * Unless we mass edit the docs (to switch to single backticks), it might lead to inconsistencies

If enabled, what should it be aliased to?
  * We could also alias it to `:any:`?
    * Any projects using that? - [yes](https://github.com/search?l=Python&q=filename%3Aconf.py+default_role+%3D&type=Code) -- `ansible/ansible-lint`, `scipy/scipy` (use a custom "autolink" role), `micropython/micropython`, `python-jsonschema/jsonschema`, etc
  * `:literal:` is probably best, docs enthusiasts can help with adding proper roles
  * If we don't want to enable the default role, sphinx-lint has an optional checker for it (already enabled on `cpython`)

* [Docs preview PR](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/92852) is still blocked on Ee allowing access to the Netlify account, which could help Adam's concerns above
  * **Mariatta** to ping ee again

* Joannah might want to talk about SEO for the docs
* [python/pythondotorg#1691](https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/1691)
    * docs.p.o SEO is not great
    * discussed in PSF channel
    * what are tools to improve? How to improve?
    * Do we have the skills for improving SEO, or do we need external expert? It may be possible for The PSF to help fund it, we can request it.
    * Existing issue: [python/pythondotorg#1691](https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/1691)
    * Adam: From Sphinx perspective: there is no SEO there. no expertise from Sphinx.
    * Petr: we may need a paid expert to handle this
    * Hugo: add more metadata. There are best practises.
    * CAM: Google has some tools that will tell you what's missing. Some of the improvements could be done in the theme.
    * Mariatta: We have a lot of inbound links
    * Pradyun: there are extensions (e.g. [sphinxext-opengraph](https://pypi.org/project/sphinxext-opengraph/) and [built in to Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#html-metadata).
    * e.g. [Google Lighthouse audits](https://web.dev/measure/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.python.org%2F3%2Flibrary%2Fcsv.html%3Fhighlight%3Dcsv%23module-csv)
    * CAM: It seems like we should be able to do a lot of this.
    * Let's do the low-hanging fruit first
    * First, we need to come up with a list of issues to improve SEO
    * Then we can see if we need to get an expert paid if need be to advise

* [C constants are documented as Python data](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96996)
  * Probably best to break this
  * Sphinx could get some support for migration

* (Hugo) Petr might want to talk about ["Broken references in Sphinx docs"](https://discuss.python.org/t/broken-references-in-sphinx-docs/19463)?
  * Discussed for a bit after the meeting ended
