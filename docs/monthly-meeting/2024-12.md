## Discussion

- [Erlend]: Undocumented `calendar` APIs; what to do? (recently brought up by Pieter
  Eendebak.)
  [According to Serhiy](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/108192#discussion_r1299892823),
  several APIs are deliberately undocumented:

  > But first than documenting these particular method or two, we should decide whether
  > they should be documented at all.
  >
  > See past issues with the `calendar` module. There may be requests for undocumented
  > methods, and some of them may even be rejected already. I think this has already
  > been discussed.

  I could not find previous discussions nor issues regarding this. IMO, we should either
  document public API, or at least add an explanatory comment in the source code that
  some APIs are deliberately undocumented. See also:

  - [gh-126164](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126164)
  - [gh-108202](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108202)

  Discussion:

  - [Petr] backwards compat ([PEP 387](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/)) says things
    without underscore are supported, even if not documented
  - [Petr] a possibility is also to deprecate the APIs, or document them as deprecated
  - [Erlend] list from Adam of undocumented APIs:
    [python/cpython#108202 (comment)](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108202#issuecomment-1686798068)
  - there was a short discussion that it was not immediately obvious if these APIs were
    meant to be public or not
  - [Erlend] will try to dig up previous discussions; maybe there are some in the
    python-dev archive; will post a summary on the
    [gh-108202](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108202) issue in a few days

- [Carol] [from Nov] API navigation or tables on long pages:
  <https://discuss.python.org/t/summary-tables-as-an-api-overview/68474>

    [docs.python.org/3/library/math.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
    [merged!]

  - Petr to figure out the Sphinx side of how to solve this, then ping Trey to polish
    the CSS
