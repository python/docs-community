## Reports and celebrations

- [PEP 732](https://peps.python.org/pep-0732/) "The Python Documentation Editorial Board" draft has been published:
  - [Discourse thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-732-the-python-documentation-editorial-board/36710)
  - Establishes the docs Editorial Board, and the relationship to the docs community
  - The idea is that the board can make larger, far-reaching decisions than just people sending PRs
  - Joanna is the author, she used to work at Real Python
  - How do you join the group? A. It's a small group with appointed members, not like this community.
  - How exactly the decisions will be made is still to be worked out.
  - This (docs community) is called the "working group"

- [Petr] Issues from the docs@python.org were converted to [a list in a GitHub issue](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110383)


## Discussion

- [Petr] [Railroad diagrams](https://discuss.python.org/t/36709/20)
  - Next stream: [youtube.com/live/vHn4YqzYlPo](https://youtube.com/live/vHn4YqzYlPo)
  - [A free REPL for learning](https://tabatkins.github.io/railroad-diagrams/generator.html)

- [Ege] Looking for help on [python-docs-bootstrapper](https://github.com/python-docs-translations/python-docs-bootstrapper/issues/8)
  - Need help with:
    - packaging (done thanks to Hugo)

    - CLI enhancements and features
  - If you have some spare time and nothing else to do, feel free to contribute!

- [Adam/Ege/Hugo] Frequency of docs.python.org builds
  - We used to build all translations & versions
    - Now we only build those that have changed, which reduces the build time.
    - There is still room for improvement: [python/docsbuild-scripts#171 (comment)](https://github.com/python/docsbuild-scripts/pull/171#issuecomment-1767764506)

- [Ege/Hugo/CAM] Analytics (Plausible) - CAM sent an e-mail (around late October), no reply yet

- [Usman] As a beginner, what's a good starting point?
  - There are some "easy" issues, although they can occasionally not be actually-easy.
  - Interested in documentation, look at diataxis and make changes?
    - Diataxis is kind of abstract for newcomers.
