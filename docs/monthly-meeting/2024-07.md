- [Hugo] Plausible stats are live!
  [plausible.io/docs.python.org](https://plausible.io/docs.python.org) &
  [plausible.io/packaging.python.org](https://plausible.io/packaging.python.org)

- [Hugo] Sphinx meetup tomorrow at 20 UTC:
  [sphinx-doc/discussions/12443](https://github.com/orgs/sphinx-doc/discussions/12443#discussioncomment-9936592)

## Discussion

- [Daniele] Options for hosting a Python documentation sprint
  (Cardiff or London, possibly Netherlands)
  - Daniele ran a successful docs sprint @ DjangoCon.
    - People choose anything that bothers you in the docs, determine the rule it
      breaks, choose what you'd do right now to fix it. Daniele can "bless" the
      idea, or not; if blessed the person can work on it.
    - Some commits made it into the docs
  - Daniele can arrange a sprint in one of the 3 locations
  - [Ned] A sprint doesn't have to be a big formal thing; it can be a meetup
  - [Daniele] Some formal structure helped
  - [Ned] You don't need special permission
  - [Daniele] Would a core dev be interested in joining?
    - Possibly: Alex, Pradyun, Tania Allard, Petr
  - [Hugo] Last year Daniele led the workshop & Hugo was clicking the merge
    button at the sprint, worked very well
  - [Petr] worried about the conference helping to get people to the event
  - [Carol] The [packaging guide (Python Packaging User Guide)](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/)
    could also use some work
  - [Ned] interested in the idea spreadsheet; maybe it can help even offline
  - [Carol] At last PyCon US, Shauna and Melanie tried to make their first docs
    PR, and found some issues in the onboarding process
    - Shauna: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icjPpmEUH0BRPDwl7oXLkpasvwZoS5io2LyTEhblku0/edit
    - Melanie: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11zxisx5XfYOsrDOn4qd-XUSpDltIOi35qiOO9fDLfnI/edit

### Python Project Documentation

*Relating to `docs.python.org`, `peps.python.org`, `devguide.python.org`, etc.*

- [Ryan] I need to load JSON with NaN values.
  [The official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load) says:
  ***parse_constant**, if specified, will be called with one of the following strings:
  '-Infinity', 'Infinity', 'NaN'. This can be used to raise an exception if
  invalid JSON numbers are encountered.*
    - I could not tell how to use this, or even if it is what I needed, until I
      Googled it and
      [found this example on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62685520).
    - As a user, I intend to open a thread on Discourse before making a PR.  But
      is there a more open conversation we should have about examples within
      documentation for docs.python.org, first?
  -  You don't need a discussion; file an issue and send a PR.

- [Hugo] Re: avoiding duplicate deprecations across What's New files:
  [Discourse](https://discuss.python.org/t/streamline-whats-new-by-moving-deprecations-and-removals-out-of-news/53997)
  - PR [python/cpython#121241](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121241)
    makes a start by moving pending removals from "What's New in 3.13" into
    includes

- [Petr] `.. versionadded:: next`:
  [python/cpython#121277](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121277)

- [Ned] Positional-only arguments:
  [python/cpython#121197](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/121197)
    - What needs EB pronouncement
    - Can we help people understand terse punctuation?
      - add a tooltip? That won't work on mobile & screen readers
      - make it a link?
        - first make sure there's a good place to link to
      - make sure [searching for `/`](https://docs.python.org/3/search.html?q=%2F)
        gets you to the right place?
      - [Daniele] Documentation on how to read the documentation isn't good
  - Ned to write this down
      - PR: https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1344
