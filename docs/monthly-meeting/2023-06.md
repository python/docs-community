## Introductions

> If there are any new people, we should do a round of introductions.


## Reports and celebrations

> 60 second updates on things you have been up to, questions you have, or developments you think people should know about. Please add yourself, and if you do not have an update to share, you can pass.

> This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

* [CAM and Erlend's PyCon US talk is now up](https://youtu.be/nMekFX2CDVk)
    * CAM also pressented a derived version at his local Huntsville Python Users Group (HSV.py)

* PEPs site updated for better readability and performance: [python/peps#3132](https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3132)

## Discussion

[PSF elections](https://discuss.python.org/t/psf-board-election-dates-for-2023): do 5h/month for Python? [Self-certify/re-self-certify to vote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwWBGkzvkWDZrxW3up_M_B7qgt1IWZlx9KJ0ucLA5WJP1vfA/viewform)
  * Re-do the certification for this year!

Infra: stats for docs
* [Demo](https://hugovk-cpython.readthedocs.io/en/plausible/)
* [Dashboard](https://plausible.io/share/hugovk-cpython.readthedocs.io?auth=XDF9fK3EB2dEHCr4sC9hn)
* Script in header: [hugovk/cpython#28b2355](https://github.com/hugovk/cpython/commit/28b23555030d58fdb52b74a547cc621c49690de0)

Dark theme is live on 3.12 and 3.13, should we deploy it to earlier releases?
* [python/python-docs-theme#44 (comment)](https://github.com/python/python-docs-theme/pull/44#issuecomment-1571331235)

EuroPython documentation sprint:
* Would it be a "good fit" for a sprint?
* How can we organize it?
  * Hugo will organize
* Who will be there from the docs community?
* Would a translation sprint be feasible?

Japanese translation

How to get started?
- Find a shortcoming & open an issue for it
- Find an open issue & ask for help:
  - [Docs community issues](https://github.com/python/docs-community/issues)
  - [Python issues](https://github.com/python/cpython/labels/docs)

Adding "how to teach this" section to PEPs
- we don't update final PEPs
- but, you can find the living docs (or create them) and improve that

Daniele @ EuroPython
- a workshop on docs organization at EuroPython
- half hour of hacking on docs while people watch



## Followups from last month(s)

* Building images with [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) / [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli).
  - @tysonclugg is trying to put together docs on concurrency which would benefit from good diagrams
  - Some other tool to explore?

* [Ned] Best entry point to working on docs, for people newly interested in helping?
    - we need clear onboarding
    - do we have style guide?
    - Cristian: In the python-docs-es team we have a page inside the docs (docs-ception) that teach the whole process https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.11/CONTRIBUTING.html
    - how do we write such docs?
        - HackMD or Google Docs
    - Python Docs Community web page, https://docs-community.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        - source: github.com/python/docs-community . e.g. front page source: [docs-community/docs/index.rst](https://github.com/python/docs-community/blob/main/docs/index.rst)
        - start having better landing page for Docs there
    - The landing page should point to where the conversations happen, e.g. the Discourse server. For a group of translators, a Telegram group is the conversation place. A conversation place helps people support each other.
- Docs Community Contributing Guide: https://docs-community.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/contributing.html

- Translation group
    - how to coordinate with the wider translations group, share tips, etc
    - Manuel: started 3 years ago: have a place to connect with other translators and resources
    - Julien introduced the tools for translation.
    - Create channel for translations
    - Cristian: It also could be a good idea to have in the main Documentation page (that we will have soon) something like "Wanna help with a translation of these docs? check out this initiatives (list of languages here)
    - Ezio: I already brought it up a couple of times, but it would be good to unify the translation infrastructure and tools (see e.g. https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw/issues/399)



### 'Internal' items

*For and about the Community or Working Group*

  * See [Discourse thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/is-there-a-good-writeup-talk-about-the-implementation-of-pep-634/21987/6)

* [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/concurrent.futures.html) reorgantization

What can we ~~steal~~ learn from Rust docs?
