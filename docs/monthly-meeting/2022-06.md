## Reports and celebrations

> This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

- CPython triage permissions for CAM, Pradyun, Adam, and Ned.


## Agenda items

### Past Action Items

- [ ] Carol (and CAM?) will be updating the readme and guide at the sprints.

Update: CAM didn't see any reviews or feedback on his PRs. (He did take some time off from Python work.)

- [ ] Creating a 'docs-approved' (wording to be agreed) label for CPython.

Needs discussion, please open issue on core-workflow repo.
(There's a template for label changes: https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/new/choose)


### 'Internal' items

*For and about the Community or Working Group*

#### Docs WG renaming to Editorial Board

> If we rename the WG to an Editorial Board, we should clarify the interpretation of the name.
>
> A quarterly meeting for the WG seems like the right cadence.
> 
> Editorial Board is the agreed name. Wikipedia has a good definition which aligns with our meaning.

Status: There is currently no ceremony/meetings for the work group/editorial board, to meet and make progress on this.

- [ ] Petr: Do the rename in all the docs

##### Docs governance

Guido: There may be a need for a bit more leadership within this group/"Community". Having an organiser for the meetings.

Petr: What does this mean in practice?

Guido: Being in charge of the agenda, how long things are discussed.

Petr: Fine with that, that's how things work today. Does this need to be formalised somehow?

Guido: Someone should have 'Convening' power -- someone to take ownership of filling the agenda, managing the admin, etc.

Adam: Typing has more active solicitation of agenda items. That might be a concrete improvement/action item out of this.

Petr: *in agreement*

CAM: The Documentation category on Discourse serves this role, and we have posts on there for some of these meetings.

Ned: Where are decisions made? Typing-sig makes decisions affecting them, as it is a forum of typing-checker implementers and users. Can Discourse be a place decisions are made?

Ned: There's agreement about *that* we should use Diataxis, but not about *how* we should implement it.

- [ ] Petr: Solicit agenda items on Discourse, for the next/future meetings

### Python Project Documentation

*Relating to `docs.python.org`, `peps.python.org`, `devguide.python.org`, &c.*

#### Proofreaders GitHub team

It would be useful to have a GitHub team that can be `@mentioned` in docs PRs to request reviews of the English grammar.

- [ ] Petr: Create a `proofreaders` team (Initially: CAM, Adam, Pradyun, Hugo), post about this team on Discourse (or similar) for a wider audience

#### Devguide improvement plans

Ezio made some comments in [a thread](https://discord.com/channels/935215565872693329/980818577559007242):

> The first plan is to overhaul a bit the GitHub docs, and is also related to other changes about labels.
The second plan is still somewhat half-baked, but I wanted to
> 1. add some instructions about following the development of CPython

Ezio: Add a changelog page to the devguide for an overview of workflow changes

- [ ] Ezio: Add a “what's new” section to the devguide (key/important changes)

CAM: Two different types of content: new pages on tools and workflow versus changes to existing policies and proceduces.

Guido: Not that useful to distinguish these, as it adds more categories. Everything is new.

Ned: Is a problem that we have different audiences? E.g. triagers versus developers versus contributors to Python

Guido: (core devs & triagers), contributors, redistributors/people who need to build Python.

> 2. add a "tips and tricks" page
> There is some overlapping between https://devguide.python.org/communication/, the instructions that I want to add, the tips and tricks page, and other pages like the GitHub bootcamp though, so I'm still trying to figure out all the things I want to include and then what would be the best way to organize them.

Ned: This sounds like Ezio is suggestion that the devguide should have a 'how to' section (one of the four sections of Diataxis).

- [ ] Ezio: Add a (How-To) Guides section with these

#### Adopting Diátaxis

https://discuss.python.org/t/adopting-the-diataxis-framework-for-python-documentation/15072

What's the next step -- survey what we already have, as [Ezio suggested](https://discuss.python.org/t/adopting-the-diataxis-framework-for-python-documentation/15072/37)?

Daniele: We should consider not only consensus on adopting the framework, but also understanding what it's about, and how it could be implement it. Best way to do it would be a couple of workshops.

Ned: What's a workshop?

Daniele: Two 2-hour interactive workshops: theory, interactive exercises, 
Normally it's in-person.

Ned: Who'd participate?

Daniele: Up to 30 people. Happy to do it for people who wouldn't be working on Python itself. Often do it at conferences.

Adam: should it be people in this call? Core devs?

Daniele: People who are pushing this thru, presenting to others. But skills should be spread far. Need enough people to make it sustainable.

We can probably get more people for a workshop that on this meeting.

- [ ] Mariatta: to work with Daniele to organize the workshop, CAM & Ned to help with logistics.

#### Workflow

(not discussed due to time)

Should we apply the `skip news` label to documentation PRs? [Discussion in Bedevere's tracker](https://github.com/python/bedevere/issues/457).

Speeding up the `Docs / Docs` CI job -- pros and cons.

## Any Other Business (AOB)

None

## Next meeting

The docs team meets on the first Monday of every month.

We have a recurring Google Calendar event for the meeting.
Let Mariatta know your email address and she can invite you.
