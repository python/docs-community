  - CAM: Petr ended up more or less doing this first, so I think we can check this off
- [x] Adam: Creating a 'docs-approved' (wording to be agreed) label for CPython.
  - [python/core-workflow#458](https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/458)

  - [discuss.python.org/t/16319](https://discuss.python.org/t/16319)
- [ ] Ezio: Add a “what's new” section to the devguide (key/important changes)
  - [python/devguide#885](https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/885)

### 'Internal' items

*For and about the Community or Working Group*

None

### Diataxis Workshop
* Many people signing up (currently oversubscribed), Mariatta will need to pick who can attend

### Python Project Documentation

*Relating to `docs.python.org`, `peps.python.org`, `devguide.python.org`, &c.*

* Writing Diataxis guidelines
  * how to approach diataxification
    * internal reorg, doc splitting, etc.
  * making sections recognizable for readers and writers
    * explicit boxes/directives
    * naming conventions for sections
    * naming conventions for anchors
      * (i.e. ``.. _<module>-guide:``; ``.. _<module>-reference:``)
      * global summary page/table
  * bunch-of-functions modules vs ~frameworks
  * page structure
    * initial paragraph with links vs ToC vs list of sections
    * howtos section organization (titles/etc) / examples vs howtos

* (Not) breaking URLs
  * How much do we care?
    - we should preserve reference links as much as possible. Tutorial/Guide/etc links we can try and preserve the path to the right location through preserving anchors (perhaps in the footer)
  * Automation to prevent breakage?
    * Apply data: Is it possible to look at web server logs to see which fragments are most often followed by incoming visitors?
      * no, anchors aren't in server logs (unless we use JS tracking)
    * [ ] Try building automation using the .inv file

* Reorganize the devguide in directories
  * [python/devguide#901](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/901)
  * Squash merge or rebase?
    * rebase

* Typing PEP migration

#### Workflow

  * [Discussion in Bedevere's tracker](https://github.com/python/bedevere/issues/457).
  * PR: [python/bedevere#485](https://github.com/python/bedevere/pull/485)
  * Labels semantics on PRs vs issues (`stdlib`/`tests`/`docs`/etc.)
  * not blocked
* Need an admin to create Netlify account: [python/cpython#92852](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/92852)


## Any Other Business
