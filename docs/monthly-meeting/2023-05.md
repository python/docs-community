## Reports and celebrations

Congrats to CAM!

Congrats Ned for the [keynote at PyCon US 2023](https://us.pycon.org/2023/about/keynote-speakers/#ned-batchelder)


* [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2023/), April 19-27 2023:
  * CAM & Erlend's talk, "[Iteration toward Transformation of the Python Documentation](https://us.pycon.org/2023/schedule/presentation/88/)", went well, good discussions afterwards and many joined the Discord wanting to contribute
  * Sprints: some docs contributors, including people making their very first CPython contribution
  * Sprints: [Hugo] switched CPython docs previews from Netlify to RtD.
    * Main benefit: multiple admins instead of single-person bottleneck with Netlify.
    * [python/cpython#103843](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/103843)
* GH action to update the link from the PR - we don't need one for Netlify
    * [JDLH thinks this means] GitHub action to update a link to a documentation preview on ReadTheDocs from the Github Pull Request page. We don't need such a preview for the current docs as published at Netlify.
    * Example of preview link: Pull Request [#104013, **gh-104010: Separate and improve docs for typing.get_origin and typing.get_args**](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/104013), contains a link to a preview of the documentation reflecting the Pull Request's effects, at [https://cpython-previews--104013.org.readthedocs.build/en/104013/](https://cpython-previews--104013.org.readthedocs.build/en/104013/).
* For moving main docs, a few more things are needed, but they're tracked at the RtD side
* We're using a personal account (Mariatta's). Not ideal. Right now community version of RtD doesn't support multiple owners, there are workarounds. Organizations are only in the commercial version so far.
* would be nice to have an ORG account.
* curious about workflow for translations, etc how to migrate the docs translations and the multi-version support to readthedocs
  * Manuel set up [python-docs-es.readthedocs.io, the Spanish translation](https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.11/) on RtD. The source files aren't in the translation repo, so the English version is added as a submodule. Translations need to be added as a new project, then connected in the admin interface.
  * For multiversion, the version switcher is injected on the bottom right. Each version is a branch or a tag, once enabled they get built.
  * That said, RtD is rebuilding the flyout (switcher) to make it easier to customize. Working together with Pradyun (Furo, Lutra)

* The “this is only a preview” header is missing.

## Discussion

* Building images with [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) / [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli).
  - @tysonclugg is trying to put together docs on concurrency which would benefit from good diagrams
  - Some other tool to explore?

* [Hugo] PEPs infra: PR opened to improve text readability / page performance:
  [python/peps#3132](https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3132)

* [Ned] Best entry point to working on docs, for people newly interested in helping?
    - we need clear onboarding
    - do we have style guide?
    - Cristian: In the python-docs-es team we have [a page inside the docs](https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.11/CONTRIBUTING.html) (docs-ception) that teaches the whole process
    - how do we write such docs?
        - HackMD or Google Docs
    - [Python Docs Community web page](https://docs-community.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        - source: [github.com/python/docs-community](https://github.com/python/docs-community) e.g. front page source: [docs-community/docs/index.rst](https://github.com/python/docs-community/blob/main/docs/index.rst)
        - start having better landing page for Docs there
    - The landing page should point to where the conversations happen, e.g. the Discourse server. For a group of translators, a Telegram group is the conversation place. A conversation place helps people support each other.
- [Docs Community Contributing Guide](https://docs-community.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/contributing.html)

- Translation group
    - how to coordinate with the wider translations group, share tips, etc
    - Manuel: started 3 years ago: have a place to connect with other translators and resources
    - Julien introduced the tools for translation.
    - Create channel for translations
    - Cristian: It also could be a good idea to have in the main Documentation page (that we will have soon) something like "Wanna help with a translation of these docs? check out this initiatives <list of languages here>"
    - Ezio: I already brought it up a couple of times, but it would be good to unify the translation infrastructure and tools (see e.g. [python/python-docs-zh-tw#399](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw/issues/399))



## Next meeting

The docs team generally meets on the first Monday of every month.

We have a recurring Google Calendar event for the meeting.
Let Mariatta know your email address and she can invite you.
