## Discussion

- [Ryan] Standard library documentation reference and adding types to it in a structured way. For example, `collections.Counter.most_common` could be written as `most_common(n: int) -> list[tuple[Any, int]]`.
  - [Petr] ... or `list[tuple[KeyType, int]]`?
  - This has been discussed. There was opposition to adding the types to the stdlib code itself.
  - [Jim] I sometimes wish for more normative, less chatty module documentation:
    - e.g. [*heapq* module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html)
    - e.g. old issue 29428 [*Doctest documentation unclear about multi-line fixtures*](https://bugs.python.org/issue29428)

- [Petr] Use emoji to illustrate good and bad example commit messages
  - https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/git-boot-camp/#accepting-and-merging-a-pull-request
  - [python/devguide#1235](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1235)
  - Should we do this for PEPs? See [python/docs-community#22](https://github.com/python/docs-community/issues/22)
  - [Hugo] See also [python/peps#3567](https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3567) for green/red sidebars for good/bad example code in PEPs
  - [Jim] don't forget accessibility constraints when coming up with the style guide. For example, some readers are red/green colorblind. ✅/❌ are good in that they are legible even without color.

- [Ryan] Thoughts about completing TOML->JSON [conversion table](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html#conversion-table) and [the TOML spec](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#spec)


## Reports and celebrations

- PEP 732 ("The Python Documentation Editorial Board") has been submitted to the steering council [python/steering-council#220](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/220)

- [Jim] FYI, Unicode Standard is changing form of authoritative standard documents from PDF to HTML, with corresponding change to document production tooling. If this is interesting I can provide more information. I am in the working group which is working on the new tooling.

## Follow-ups from previous meeting(s)

- [Petr] [Railroad diagrams](https://discuss.python.org/t/36709/20)
  - Streams have kind of been on other topics too

- [Ege/Hugo/CAM] Analytics (Plausible) - CAM sent an e-mail (around late October), no reply yet
  - CAM sent multiple follow-ups
  - Hugo sent a follow-up two weeks ago
  - Discussion on core dev Discord that is supportive
  - Still no reply... :(

## Next meeting

The docs team generally meets on the first Tuesday of every month around 20:00-ish UTC.

- [Jim] The first Tuesday of next month is 2 January. Will we be ready for this meeting on the day after New Year's Day? Answer: Basically yes; those who are ready will show up, others won't.

We have a recurring Google Calendar event for the meeting.
Let Mariatta know your email address and she can invite you.
