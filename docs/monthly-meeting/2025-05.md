## Discussion

- [Jim DeLaHunt] Discord invitation link difficulties.
When I (Jim) follow https://discord.com/invite/vKTkwJKG?event=1347635566518210613 , Discord tells me "Invite Invalid", "This invite may be expired, or you might not have permission to join". Note also that Google Calendar invite has a different link, https://discord.gg/RxKXyPYV?event=1303462925834522666 . Should it be different? And, it causes Discord to give me the same error message.
I am a very peripheral member of this group, so I am not bothered by not getting access via Discord. I can still read the HackMD text. But this Discord behaviour is probably not what is desired.
  - Try this link: https://discord.gg/nECCQWk4up?event=1347635566518210613
  - Thank you! That link causes Discord to offer me an invitation, which is great. But then Discord tells me that my browser (current Firefox on macOS) is not supported. Maybe I have to download the Discord app? And the error message says that Firefox is a supported browser. Curious.
  - Weird... I'm on Firefox on Linux & it works for me
  - [Jim] The @encukou invitation link worked for me using Safari on macOS. Thank you for your help.

- [Keith] The Translation team has been doing a lot of work.

- [Keith] Wiki work is stalled for the moment, as the team had different, more urgent priorities pop up.

- [Keith] Question about how to edit the python.org website; after PyCon focus might move towards that.
  - https://discuss.python.org/t/process-for-making-changes-to-the-existing-python-org-website/89120/7

- [Blaise] Been holding Sphinx office hours; not many people showed up. Some suggestions were to distinguish the audience:
    - have an asynchronous space for newbie questions (eg. #sphinx on python.org discourse, a sphinx channPython Discord) https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/support.html 
    - have a synchronous(ish) space for devs or contributors (eg. the `writeTheDocs` slack folks want to contribute but the [sphinx contributor guide](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html) needs more guidance on how to navigate between `docutils` and `sphinx` . There is also a lot of subclassing that makes it hard for a new person to know where things are happening.
    - Make it easy for newcomers to lurk and observe activity before joining.
    - [Jim] Add office hours info to the (support page)[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/support.html]. If I was working on a project and wanted to use Sphinx for docs, and I wanted help, I would end up on it. I don't see a mention of office hours on that page.

- [Jeff] Waiting for guidance on how to take over Indonesian Translation PEP https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-545-update-pep/83534
- [Jeff] Asking for advice for about translation management:
    - Python Transifex docs: https://github.com/python-docs-translations/transifex-automations
    - Transifex sample workflows (WIP): https://github.com/python-docs-translations/transifex-automations/pull/130/files
