## Discussion

- [Jim DeLaHunt] Discord invitation link difficulties. When I
  follow <https://discord.com/invite/vKTkwJKG?event=1347635566518210613>, Discord
  tells me "Invite Invalid", "This invite may be expired, or you might not have
  permission to join". Note also that Google Calendar invite has a different link:
  <https://discord.gg/RxKXyPYV?event=1303462925834522666>. Should it be different?
  And, it causes Discord to give me the same error message. I am a very peripheral
  member of this group, so I am not bothered by not getting access via Discord.
  I can still read the HackMD text. But this Discord behaviour is probably not what is desired.
  - [Petr] Try this link: <https://discord.gg/nECCQWk4up?event=1347635566518210613>.
  - Thank you! That link causes Discord to offer me an invitation, which is great. But then Discord tells me that my browser (current Firefox on macOS) is not supported. Maybe I have to download the Discord app? And the error message says that Firefox is a supported browser. Curious.
  - Weird... I'm on Firefox on Linux & it works for me
  - [Jim] Petr's invitation link worked for me using Safari on macOS. Thank you for your help.

- [Keith] The Translation team has been doing a lot of work.

- [Keith] Wiki work is stalled for the moment, as the team had different, more
  urgent priorities pop up.

- [Keith] Question about how to edit the python.org website; after PyCon focus might move towards that.
  - [Discourse: Process for making changes to the existing python.org website](https://discuss.python.org/t/process-for-making-changes-to-the-existing-python-org-website/89120/7)

- [Blaise] Been holding Sphinx office hours; not many people showed up.
  Some suggestions were to distinguish the audience:
    - have an asynchronous space for newbie questions (e.g. `#sphinx` on [python.org Discourse](https://discuss.python.org/), a Sphinx channel on Python Discord)
    - have a synchronous(ish) space for devs or contributors
      (e.g. the `writeTheDocs` slack folks want to contribute but the [Sphinx contributor guide](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/internals/contributing.html)
      needs more guidance on how to navigate between `docutils` and `sphinx` .
      There is also a lot of subclassing that makes it hard for a new person to
      know where things are happening.
    - Make it easy for newcomers to lurk and observe activity before joining.
    - [Jim] Add office hours info to the [support page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/support.html).
      If I was working on a project and wanted to use Sphinx for docs, and I wanted help,
      I would end up on it. I don't see a mention of office hours on that page.

- [Jeff] Still waiting for guidance on how to take over Indonesian Translation.
- [Jeff] No update on the [PEP 545 proposals](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-545-update-pep/83534).
- [Jeff] Asking for advice about translation management.
    - [Stan] Some useful links if you plan on using transifex:
        - [Python Transifex docs](https://github.com/python-docs-translations/transifex-automations)
        - [Transifex sample workflows (WIP)](https://github.com/python-docs-translations/transifex-automations/pull/130/files)
