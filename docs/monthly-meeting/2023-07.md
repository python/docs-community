## Discussion

* Thoughts on MDN icons (see e.g. the ToC sidebar for [Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)), as a compact way to flag API status in overviews?
    * 🗑️ = deprecated
    * ⚠️ = non-standard/implementation-specific
    * 🧪 = experimental/unstable

* Programmatic handling of `deprecated-removed`
    * Followup from [soft deprecation discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/formalize-the-concept-of-soft-deprecation-dont-schedule-removal-in-pep-387-backwards-compatibility-policy/27957/73)
    * MVP should be up by next meeting:
        * A list of everything that's deprecated
        * docs on the directive in the devguide

* Thoughts on putting a translation progress notice in docs pages (for each language)? [python/docsbuild-scripts#148](https://github.com/python/docsbuild-scripts/issues/148)
    * Sounds like a good idea
    * Sphinx issue is open
        * This should be done in Sphinx first - Manuel will look into it ([sphinx-doc/sphinx#11157](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/11157))
    * Spanish docs have a [neat progress page](https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.11/progress.html)
        * Should we add it to all translations?


## Next meeting
