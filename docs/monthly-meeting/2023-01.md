## Roll call

- Petr Viktorin, `@encukou`
- Jim DeLaHunt, `@JDLH` (a conflict in real life took him away for 20 minutes)
- Mariatta `@mariatta`
- Hugo van Kemenade `@hugovk`
- C.A.M. Gerlach `@CAM-Gerlach`


## Quick updates - Introductions

> 60 second updates on things you have been up to, questions you have, or developments you think people should know about. Please add yourself, and if you do not have an update to share, you can pass.

- (Hugo) SEO improvements. Using Sphinx extension that generate images for every single page that we have. But it is too heavy for CPython docs (40 MBs and nearly 500 images), using Matplotlib to do it, which is pretty heavy library. Contributors shouldn't need to be installing this additional library, so we need to find solutions. The extra SEO images should only be generated when publishing CPython docs, and not for building locally. There should be an option to do it.
  - Check with Ee re. the file sizes

- (CAM) PR for PEPs PR templates submitted: [python/peps#2956](https://github.com/python/peps/pull/2956)

- (CAM) What's New issues.
  * [python/cpython#100734](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100734)
    Syncing changelog/What's New between versions

    * CAM will sync things manually for now, we might want some automation in the future
    * Would be good to note the Git commands in the RM checklist (PEP 101)


## Reports and celebrations

> This is a place to make announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! We'll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

* Mariatta will be giving [a talk about "Contributing to Python"](https://www.meetup.com/indypy/events/289628025/) tomorrow; will cover Docs contribution for sure.


## Discussion

### 'Internal' items

*For and about the Community or Working Group*

- Time for the meeting
  - Let's alternate the Monday slot with another time, so other people can join?
  - This is probably not the best audience :)


### Python Project Documentation

- [Trouble installing Python](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/docs@python.org/thread/I7JDNUYWIZ3QVY33IDYWFKDTZMIPIVNS/)
    - [Running scripts with a GUI](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#running-scripts-with-a-gui)

- The docs mailing list:
    - I'm referring to docs@python.org
    - This is [linked](https://docs.python.org/3/bugs.html#documentation-bugs) from docs.python.org from "report a bug" section
    - [python/devguide#1025](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/1025)


### Devguide, PEPs, workflow, etc.

* Release cycle chart in the Devguide
  * Followup: @CAM-Gerlach opened devguide issues for adding the additional development phase transition dates [python/devguide#998](https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/998) & a table of individual minor versions [python/devguide#999](https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/999)
  * Petr is (slowly) working on generating the chart by Python

* [python/devguide#1020](https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/1020): Function signatures in docs (positional-only markers, defaults, `[]` syntax)


## Next meeting

The docs team generally meets on the first Monday of every month.

We have a recurring Google Calendar event for the meeting.
Let Mariatta know your email address and she can invite you.
