Contributing to the Documentation Community
===========================================

Python Documentation is an open community made up of people all over the world.
We invite participation of all forms - whether that be contributing
code, advice, documentation, support, or just a friendly face!

If you'd like to start getting involved with Python documentation projects,
here are a few resources to get you started.

Do I really have something to contribute?
-----------------------------------------

Absolutely.

Get connected
-------------

First off, get yourself connected with the documentation community online. There
are a few places where we have conversations and discussion:

- `The Python Discourse category <https://discuss.python.org/c/core-dev/documentation/26>`_
  is the main place for discussions.
- `The GitHub repository <https://github.com/python/docs-community>`_
  hosts this documentation and an issue tracker.
- `The Discord server <https://discord.gg/sMWqvzXvde>`_
  hosts monthly meetings and real-rime discussion.

Thank you!
