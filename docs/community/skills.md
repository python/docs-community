## A few general ways to help out


### Python-specific knowledge

- **Code structure of the docs repository**

## A note on complexity of tasks

Depth/expertise required for certain kinds of tasks can be hard to nail down and not at

a good rule of thumb is to reach out to another team member to help
you scope the work you'd like to do, and to set expectations.
