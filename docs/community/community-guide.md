# Documentation Community Team Guide

This page holds resources for members of the Documentation community.
They're meant to guide team members to be happy, productive members of the
team!

## What are the team resources?

There are a few resources that are particularly useful for team members. Here's
a quick list to get you started.
- devguide
- docs
- python_docs_theme
- discourse channel


### General information about communication channels

We are trying to organize our discussions in order to help both contributors and
maintainers find and choose the right communication channels and have a positive experience :-)

In this respect, we are using:
1. [BPO](https://bugs.python.org) and GitHub issues for specific discussions related to changing a repository's content. This is determined by doc project.
2. The [Discourse forum](http://discuss.python.org/) for general discussions, support
questions, or just as a place where we can inspire each other.

## How can I help?
