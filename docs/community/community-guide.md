# Documentation Community Team Guide

This page holds resources for members of the Documentation community.
They're meant to guide team members to be happy, productive members of the
team!

## What are the team resources?

There are a few resources that are particularly useful for team members. Here's
a quick list to get you started.

- [Python Developers Guide (DevGuide)](https://devguide.python.org)
- [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Python Docs Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/python/python-docs-theme)
- [Python docs translations dashboard](https://python-docs-translations.github.io/dashboard/)
- [Documentation Discourse category](https://discuss.python.org/c/documentation/26)
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DJxvZXNHm2)

### General information about communication channels

We are trying to organize our discussions in order to help both contributors and
maintainers find and choose the right communication channels and have a positive experience :-)

In this respect, we are using:

1. GitHub issues for specific discussions related to changing a repository's content.
2. The [Discourse forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/documentation/26) for general discussions, support
questions, or just as a place where we can inspire each other.

## How can I help?

Read the devguide's section on documentation.
Visit the Python repo's GitHub issues and look for [issues tagged with "docs"](https://github.com/python/cpython/labels/docs).
