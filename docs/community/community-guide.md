# Documentation Community Team Guide

This page holds resources for members of the Documentation community.
They're meant to guide team members to be happy, productive members of the
team!

## What are the team resources?

There are a few resources that are particularly useful for team members. Here's
a quick list to get you started.

- [devguide](https://devguide.python.org)
- [docs](https://docs.python.org)
- python_docs_theme
- [discourse category](https://discuss.python.org/c/documentation/26)
- discord channel

### General information about communication channels

We are trying to organize our discussions in order to help both contributors and
maintainers find and choose the right communication channels and have a positive experience :-)

In this respect, we are using:

1. GitHub issues for specific discussions related to changing a repository's content.
2. The [Discourse forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/documentation/26) for general discussions, support
questions, or just as a place where we can inspire each other.

## How can I help?

Read the devguide's section on documentation.
Visit the Python repo's GitHub issues and look for issues tagged with `docs`.
