# Python Documentation Community

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/docs-community/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs-community.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The Python Documentation Working Group (Docs WG) was created and accepted by the **Python Steering Council** in 2021
to help bootstrap a larger documentation team and community.

This repo serves as documentation for the Docs WG, which is funny, in a recursive kind of way.

For example, to find out more about us and what we do, [read the docs](https://docs-community.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
